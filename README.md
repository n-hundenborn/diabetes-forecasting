## Getting started
Make sure the following is installed and working properly on your system:
- a code editor/IDE of your choice e.g. Visual Studio Code
- Python
- pip (Python package manager)
- git

### Cloning the repository
After setting up your github credentials open the terminal in the desired folder destination and enter:

    git clone https://github.com/n-hundenborn/diabetes-forecasting.git


### Manage your python environment
To install all necessary python packages you can use either `pip` or `pipenv`.

To install pipenv open the terminal (either integrated VS Code or OS-specific) and enter `pip install pipenv`.

To install all python dependencies defined in _requirements.txt_ run:

    pipenv install -r requirements.txt
and select the newly created environment (something like: _diabetes_forecasting-enpCFhd_ ...) if necessary on the top right corner of VS Code.
